> Time and Space Complexity
:(NotSoCorrect)amount of time and Space taken by a program/Algorithm to solve a Problem!
:(Correct)Order of Time and Space taken by a program/Algorithm to solve a Problem!

> Algoritham
:Finite No. of Steps to complete a Task!

Note:for a given Task "T" there can be "n" no. of Algoritham!

:> Selecting Best Algoritham -> on the basis of Best Time Complexity and Space Complexity!

Time Complexity
1)Best Case     : Least Time Complexity
2)Average case  : Average Time Complexity
3)Worst Case    : Maximum Time Complexity

Asymtotic Notations: Notations To Represent T(n) (Time Complexity)
1)Big Omega     (Best case)
2)Theta         (Average case)
3)Big O         (Worst case)

4)small omega
5)Small o
Note: small omega & small o are for reserch purposes!
